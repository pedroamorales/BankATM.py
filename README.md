Hello! Welcome to pedroamorales' first interactive project. 

BankATM.py is a mock bank atm utilized to understand and simulate an atm;s functions.

START by introducing an account name and starting balance.

CHOOSE between deposits, withdrawals, or viewing account balances. 

REPEAT!!

++ DON'T get too greedy though, you might just find yourself at a negative balance ;)
