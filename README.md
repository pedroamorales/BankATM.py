Hello! Welcome to pedroamorales' first interactive project. 

BankATM.py is a mock bank ATM utilized to understand and simulate its functions.

START by introducing an account name and starting balance.

CHOOSE between deposits, withdrawals, or viewing account balances. 

Sign Out or REPEAT!!

++ DON'T get too greedy though, you might just find yourself at a negative balance ;) ++
